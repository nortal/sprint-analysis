Sprint Analysis
===============

Although JIRA has tons of options to add charts based on your favourite queries and
filters it is kind of difficult (or impossible) to generate certain charts. For example
I've been especially interested in the split of how much time was spent on bugs, improvements
or engineering tasks.

Also quickly highlighting issues that we've haven't estimated too well is a big plus when you
go over the sprints stats after the sprint.
